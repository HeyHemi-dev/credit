## The Service

With Thanks is a tool that helps photographers collect and format wedding supplier credits. Photographers create events, send a share link to couples, and couples contribute supplier information through that link. With Thanks then generates formatted credit lists (for Instagram, email, and other platforms) that make it easy to properly acknowledge all the suppliers involved in a wedding.

With Thanks is currently free to use. We may introduce paid features in the future, and if we do, we will provide notice before those changes take effect.

By using With Thanks, you agree that we may collect, use, and share your information as described in these Terms and in our Privacy Policy.

---

**Put simply**

With Thanks helps photographers collect supplier details from couples via a simple link, then formats those details into copy-ready credits. It's currently free.

## Using With Thanks

### Who can use With Thanks

You may use With Thanks only if you are at least 18 years old and can form a binding contract under the laws of New Zealand.

When you create an account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.

If we have previously disabled or suspended your account for breaching these Terms, our other policies, or for legal reasons, you must not create another account without our express written permission.

---

**Put simply**

You need to be 18 or older, honest about who you are, and playing by the rules to use With Thanks.

### Photographer accounts

If you create a photographer account (using Google sign-in), you are responsible for:

- all events you create and the information you add to them
- managing the share links you generate for couples
- ensuring that any supplier information you add is accurate and that you have permission to share it (see "Adding supplier information" below)

### Accessing events via share link

If you access an event through a share link provided by a photographer:

- You do not need to create an account
- **By using the share link, you agree to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy**
- Your access is limited to the specific event associated with that link
- The photographer who created the event can revoke your access at any time
- If the photographer deletes the event, you will lose access to the information

---

**Put simply**

Photographers have accounts and create events. Couples use a share link to contribute—no account needed, but by using the link you agree to these Terms.

### Your licence to use the Service

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms and our policies, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable licence to access and use With Thanks for your personal or business use as contemplated by these Terms.

You must not:

- copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from the Service, except to the extent this cannot be restricted under applicable law
- use any automated means (including bots, scrapers, crawlers, or similar tools) to access, extract, download, or index content from the Service without our prior written consent
- attempt to access data you do not have permission to access or to interfere with the proper operation of the Service
- use supplier information for any purpose unrelated to wedding supplier credits (such as building marketing lists or sending unsolicited commercial messages)

All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by us and our licensors.

---

**Put simply**

You can use With Thanks for managing wedding credits, but you do not get ownership of the platform or the right to scrape or misuse supplier data.

### Prohibited conduct

In using With Thanks, you agree that you will not:

- add supplier information to the Service without having permission to share that information (see "Adding supplier information" below)
- scrape, harvest, or bulk-export supplier information from With Thanks
- use the Service to send unsolicited commercial messages or spam
- attempt to bypass or interfere with any security, rate-limiting, or access controls that we apply
- share share links publicly (for example, on social media or public forums) or with people who should not have access to that event
- create fake or spam events or supplier records
- use the Service to engage in any unlawful, misleading, deceptive, or harmful activity

Any use of With Thanks that is not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate intellectual property and other laws.

---

**Put simply**

Do not scrape supplier data, add information without permission, spam people, or share event links publicly. Use With Thanks honestly and for its intended purpose.

## Your content and data

### What is "User Content"

With Thanks allows you to create and contribute information, including event details (such as event name, wedding date, and region), supplier information (such as business name, email, social media handles, and region), contribution notes, and formatted credit lists (together, "User Content").

You retain all rights of ownership in your User Content. However, you are solely responsible for the User Content you create or contribute, including ensuring that it complies with these Terms and with applicable law.

### Adding supplier information

With Thanks allows you to add information about wedding suppliers (such as business name, email address, Instagram and TikTok handles, and region) to events you create or have access to.

**When you add supplier information to With Thanks, you represent and warrant that:**

- you have the supplier's permission to share their contact details and business information, **or**
- you are sharing publicly available business contact information

Supplier information is treated as business contact information. We plan to notify suppliers when they are added to the platform so they can claim their profile and control the information shared.

**You agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or losses arising from your unauthorised or inappropriate sharing of supplier information.**

---

**Put simply**

When you add a supplier to With Thanks, you confirm you have permission to share their information. You are responsible if you add supplier info without permission.

### How we can use your User Content

By creating or providing any User Content on or through With Thanks, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable licence to:

- use, host, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, and display your User Content to operate, maintain, and improve the Service
- process your User Content to generate formatted credit lists
- use supplier information you provide to deduplicate supplier records across the platform
- use supplier contact information to notify suppliers about related services we operate that may be relevant to their business

This licence is granted without any obligation on us to compensate you and without any expectation of payment, unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing.

This licence lasts for as long as your User Content remains on With Thanks. If you remove your User Content or delete your account, we will cease actively using that content going forward, except that copies may remain in our systems for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.

You also grant us the right to sublicense this licence to our service providers and partners (such as hosting providers and analytics providers) to the extent reasonably required for us to provide and secure the Service.

---

**Put simply**

You give us permission to use your data to run With Thanks, generate credits, and deduplicate suppliers. If you delete your data, we stop using it going forward, but backup copies may remain.

### Supplier information and deduplication

Supplier records in With Thanks are shared across events to prevent duplicates and maintain data quality. This means:

- When you search for a supplier, you may see supplier records that other users have added
- When you add a supplier, we check whether they already exist in the database (using email address as the primary identifier)
- If a supplier already exists, you will be prompted to select the existing record rather than creating a duplicate

All users who add supplier information must have permission to do so, as described above.

Supplier information (business names, email addresses, and social media handles) is visible to authenticated users of the platform (photographers who have signed in, and couples who have access via a share link to an event where that supplier is tagged).

---

**Put simply**

Supplier records are shared across the platform to prevent duplicates. When you search, you may see suppliers added by other users. Everyone who adds supplier info must have permission to share it.

## Intellectual Property

### Your intellectual property

Except for the licence you grant us under section 3.3, you retain ownership of all intellectual property rights you hold in your User Content.

### Our intellectual property

All rights in and to With Thanks (excluding User Content) are owned by us or our licensors. This includes all:

- software, code, and databases
- designs, branding, logos, and trade marks
- layouts, user interfaces, and features
- text, graphics, and other content we create

You must not use our name, logo, or trade marks without our prior written permission, except as allowed by law (for example, fair dealing).

Nothing in these Terms transfers any ownership of our intellectual property rights to you. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

---

**Put simply**

You own your data, we own the With Thanks platform and brand, and neither of us transfers ownership just by using the Service.

## Security and share links

We care about the security of your account and your information.

We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of With Thanks, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures.

You agree to:

- keep your login details secure and not share them with anyone else
- choose a strong password and change it if you suspect it has been compromised
- notify us promptly if you become aware of any unauthorised access to your account or any other breach of security

### Share links

When you create an event, we generate a unique share link that allows couples to access and contribute to that event without creating an account.

**Share links grant full access to event data. Treat them like passwords:**

- Only share links with people who should have access to that specific event
- Do not post share links publicly (for example, on social media or public forums)
- If a share link is compromised, contact us immediately so we can revoke it

Share links are convenient but less secure than password-protected accounts. You are responsible for controlling who you share links with. We are not responsible for unauthorised access resulting from your sharing of a link.

We may revoke or disable share links if we reasonably believe they have been compromised or are being misused.

---

**Put simply**

We work to keep your account safe, but you need to protect your login. Share links are like passwords—only share them with people who should access that specific event.

## Third-party links and services

With Thanks may link to or integrate with third-party websites, platforms, or services (for example, a supplier's own website or social media profile).

We do not control and are not responsible for:

- the content, products, or services provided by third parties, or
- any loss or damage that may arise from your use of third-party sites or services

If you access any third-party website, service, or content from With Thanks, you do so at your own risk. Third-party sites will have their own terms and privacy policies, which you should read carefully.

---

**Put simply**

We can link you out to supplier websites and social media, but what happens on those services is between you and them.

## Accounts, suspension, and termination

You may delete your account at any time by contacting us.

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to With Thanks (including your account) if we reasonably believe that:

- you have seriously or repeatedly breached these Terms or our policies
- your use of the Service is causing or is likely to cause harm to us, other users, or third parties
- we are required to do so by law, a court order, or a regulator

In urgent cases (for example, where we reasonably consider there is a risk of harm, fraud, or serious legal or regulatory risk), we may suspend or restrict access to your account or to certain features immediately and notify you afterwards where appropriate.

Where appropriate and practicable, we will provide you with notice before suspending or terminating your account and, where reasonable, an opportunity to respond.

If your account is deleted:

- your profile and most of your User Content will no longer be accessible
- we may retain copies of your User Content and account information for a reasonable period for backup, archival, and audit purposes, as described in these Terms and in our Privacy Policy
- if you are a photographer and you delete an event, couples with share links to that event will lose access to the information

---

**Put simply**

You can leave whenever you like by contacting us, and we can restrict or close accounts where there is harm, risk, or serious breaches of these Terms.

## Reporting and moderation

We aim to keep With Thanks a safe and useful tool for photographers, couples, and suppliers.

You can report content or behaviour that you believe is:

- unlawful
- added without permission (for example, your supplier information was added without your consent)
- infringing your intellectual property rights or privacy rights
- abusive, harmful, or otherwise contrary to these Terms

When we receive a report, we will review it and take whatever action we consider appropriate, which may include:

- asking the user to modify or remove the content
- hiding, restricting, or removing the content ourselves
- revoking share links if they have been misused
- suspending or terminating the relevant account in serious or repeated cases
- where required by law, reporting the matter to relevant authorities

We may refuse, hide, restrict, or remove any User Content at any time, for any reason, whether or not we have received a report, if we reasonably consider that it breaches these Terms, our policies, or applicable law, or is otherwise inappropriate. We are not required to explain every moderation decision, but where appropriate we may provide a brief explanation or a way for you to respond.

---

**Put simply**

You can report content that feels wrong or was added without permission. We may remove content, revoke share links, or restrict accounts to protect users and comply with the law.

We do not promise that the Service will always be:

- suitable for your particular purposes

We do not control and are not responsible for the actions or omissions of users, including:

- the accuracy of supplier information or event details

We do not verify supplier information, and we are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of User Content.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any rights you have under the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, the Fair Trading Act 1986, or any other law that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited.

Where you are using the Service for business purposes, you agree that:

- the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 does not apply, and
- to the extent permitted by law, any guarantees, warranties, or conditions implied by law are excluded

---

**Put simply**

We provide With Thanks as it is and cannot guarantee it will always be perfect, or that every supplier record will be accurate. We do not verify user-contributed information.

- any loss of profit, revenue, goodwill, or opportunity
- any loss of data, including loss of User Content

  - your use of, or inability to use, the Service
  - any conduct or content of any other user or third party on the Service
  - unauthorised access to or use of your account or information, where we have taken reasonable security steps
  - your sharing of a share link with someone who should not have access to that event

To the extent we are liable to you and our liability cannot be excluded, our total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or in connection with the Service or these Terms is limited to the greater of:

- the total fees (if any) you have paid to us for use of the Service in the 12 months immediately before the event giving rise to the claim, or
- NZD $100

This limitation does not apply to any liability we may have which cannot be excluded or limited under New Zealand law (for example, liability for loss or damage caused by our fraud or deliberate misconduct).

---

**Put simply**

If something goes wrong, our financial responsibility to you is limited, except where New Zealand law says we cannot limit it.

## Copyright complaints and takedown process

We may remove or disable access to content that we believe, on reasonable grounds, may infringe the rights of others. Where appropriate, we may notify the user who added the content and provide them with an opportunity to respond.

If you repeatedly upload or share infringing content, we may suspend or terminate your account.

---

**Put simply**

If you believe content on With Thanks infringes your rights, contact us with details. We may remove the content and, for repeat infringers, suspend accounts.

## Privacy and data handling

Our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information about you, your wedding plans, and supplier information are governed by our Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.

In summary, we use your information to:

- operate, maintain, and improve the Service

- meet our legal obligations

We store and process data using service providers that may be located in New Zealand or overseas. Where we transfer personal information outside New Zealand, we take reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected by privacy safeguards that are comparable to those in New Zealand law.

We handle personal information in line with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and take reasonable steps to ensure that any comparable privacy safeguards apply where personal information is stored or accessed outside New Zealand.

You have rights under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 to access and request correction of your personal information. Our Privacy Policy explains how to exercise these rights and how to contact us.

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully for more detail.

---

**Put simply**

We use your information to run With Thanks, enable credit tagging and sharing, and meet our legal obligations, in line with New Zealand privacy law.

## Changes to the Service and to these Terms

We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, including by adding or removing features. We may introduce paid features in the future, and if we do, we will provide reasonable notice before those changes take effect.

We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, by email or by a notice within the Service) before the changes take effect. The updated Terms will apply from the date stated in the notice.

If you continue to use With Thanks after the updated Terms take effect, you will be taken to have accepted them. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you should stop using the Service and delete your account.

We may update the app and these Terms over time. We will let you know about important changes, and by continuing to use With Thanks you accept the updated Terms.

## Governing law and disputes

These Terms, and your use of With Thanks, are governed by the laws of New Zealand.

You and we agree that the courts of New Zealand will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service, except where applicable law provides you with a non-excludable right to bring a claim in another forum.

Before starting formal proceedings, we encourage you to contact us to attempt to resolve any issue informally.

---

**Put simply**

These Terms are based on New Zealand law, and most disputes will be handled in New Zealand courts after we have tried to sort things out informally.

## General terms

### Entire agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, form the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of With Thanks and supersede any prior agreements or understandings relating to the Service.

### Severability

If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to the minimum extent necessary or, if modification is not possible, treated as deleted. The rest of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.

### No waiver

If we do not exercise or enforce a right under these Terms, that does not mean we have waived that right. Any waiver must be in writing and will only apply to the specific situation in which it is given.

We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms (for example, in connection with a sale of our business) without your consent. If we do so, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that this does not materially reduce your rights under these Terms.

### Relationship of the parties

Nothing in these Terms creates any partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us. You and we are independent contracting parties.
