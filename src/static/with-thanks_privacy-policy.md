## About this statement

This Privacy Statement explains how With Thanks collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information when you use our platform, website, and related services (together, the "Service"). It is intended to be read alongside our Terms of Use. When we say "we", "us", or "our" in this Privacy Statement, we are referring to the operator of With Thanks.

By using With Thanks, you agree that we may collect, use, and share your information as described in this Privacy Statement and in line with New Zealand privacy law, including the Privacy Act 2020.

---

**Put simply**

This page explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, and your rights under New Zealand privacy law.

## The information we collect

We collect personal information from you when you use With Thanks. This includes information about:

**User accounts**

- name and email address (through Google sign-in)
- computer, device, or network (such as IP address, device identifiers, browser type, and basic technical diagnostics)

**Events and credits you create**

- event details (such as event name, wedding date, and region)
- share links that allow couples to access and edit event information
- supplier credits and contribution notes you or couples add to events

**Supplier information**

- supplier details that you or others add to the platform (such as business name, email address, Instagram and TikTok handles, and region)
- this information is treated as business contact information and may be visible to authenticated users of the platform

**Activity on the platform**

- interactions with the Service (such as events you create, suppliers you search for or add, and features you use)
- information about how you interact with emails we send you (such as whether you opened or clicked on them)

We collect most information directly from you. We also receive basic account information from Google when you sign in using Google OAuth. We may collect some information automatically when you use the Service (such as device and usage information).

---

**Put simply**

We collect your name and email when you sign in, event and supplier details you add to the platform, and basic device and usage information so we can run the service.

## How we use your information

We use your personal information to operate, secure, and improve With Thanks. In particular, we use your information to:

- create and manage your user account
- enable you to create events and manage supplier credits
- generate and manage share links so couples can access and contribute to their event's supplier list
- deduplicate supplier records to maintain data quality (using email addresses as unique identifiers)
- send important service emails (such as account confirmations, security alerts, and changes to our policies)
- notify suppliers when they are added to the platform so they can claim and manage their profile (planned feature)
- respond to your questions, feedback, and requests
- maintain security, prevent and detect fraudulent or abusive activity, and enforce our Terms of Use and other policies
- analyse usage trends and improve the platform's performance, reliability, design, and features
- comply with our legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from regulators or other authorities

We may use aggregated or de-identified information (for example, statistics about platform usage) to understand and improve With Thanks. We will not attempt to re-identify individuals from aggregated or de-identified information.

---

**Put simply**

We use your information to run and secure With Thanks, enable credit tagging and sharing, improve the product, communicate with you, and meet our legal obligations.

## Sharing your information

### Our team and service providers

Besides our own staff and contractors who need access to perform their roles, we share your personal information with trusted service providers who help us provide and run With Thanks. This may include:

- authentication providers (Google OAuth via Neon Auth) to enable secure sign-in
- cloud hosting, database, and computing providers (Neon, Vercel)
- email delivery and communication tools (Resend)
- analytics and performance monitoring providers
- security and fraud prevention tools

We require our service providers to protect your information and to use it only for the purposes we specify.

### Share link holders (couples)

When you create an event and generate a share link for a couple, anyone with that share link can view and edit all information about that event, including:

- the event details you have entered
- all supplier information tagged to that event (including supplier names, email addresses, and social media handles)
- contribution notes and service categories

**Share links grant access to event data. Only share links with people you trust and who should have access to that event's information.**

### Supplier information

Supplier information (business names, email addresses, and social media handles) is visible to authenticated users of the platform. This includes:

- photographers who have signed in with a With Thanks account
- couples who have access via a share link to an event where that supplier is tagged

**When you add supplier information to With Thanks, you confirm that you have permission to share that information.** Suppliers are treated as business entities, and their contact details are considered business contact information. We plan to notify suppliers when they are added to the platform so they can claim their profile and control the information shared.

We may use supplier contact information to notify them about related services we operate that may be relevant to their business (such as Wedding Ready, our wedding supplier discovery platform). Both With Thanks and Wedding Ready are operated by us, and we will handle supplier information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

We do not sell supplier information or any other personal information.

### Legal and safety reasons

We may disclose your information if we reasonably believe this is necessary to:

- comply with the law or with a court order, warrant, or other legal process
- respond to lawful requests from regulators or enforcement agencies
- protect the rights, property, or safety of With Thanks, our users, suppliers, or the public
- detect, investigate, or prevent fraud, security issues, or abuse of the Service

Where it is lawful and reasonable for us to do so, we will consider whether we can let you know before or shortly after we make this kind of disclosure.

### Business changes

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any new holder of your information continues to protect it in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and New Zealand privacy law.

---

**Put simply**

We share your information with trusted providers who help us run With Thanks, with couples via share links, and may disclose information when the law or safety requires it. We do not sell your personal information. Supplier details are visible to authenticated users as business contact information.

## Analytics

We may use third-party analytics tools to help us understand how people use With Thanks so we can improve the service. This may include basic usage statistics and performance monitoring.

We do not sell your personal information. We may create aggregated or de-identified information (for example, statistics about feature usage) to understand and improve With Thanks. We will not attempt to re-identify individuals from aggregated or de-identified information.

---

**Put simply**

We use analytics tools to understand how the platform is used and to improve it, but we do not sell your data.

## How we store and protect your information

We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised access, use, modification, or disclosure.

We do this by, for example:

- storing information in secure, encrypted cloud systems
- limiting access to personal information to people who need it to do their job or provide the Service
- using technical safeguards such as access controls, monitoring, and security tools
- reviewing our security practices regularly

However, no online service can be guaranteed as completely secure. To help protect your information, you should:

- keep your login details secure and not share them with anyone else
- choose a strong password and change it if you suspect it has been compromised
- only share event share links with people who should have access to that event's information
- tell us promptly if you become aware of any unauthorised access to your account or other security issue

We retain personal information only for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or as required by law. After that, we take reasonable steps to delete it or to store it in a form that does not personally identify you.

---

**Put simply**

We use secure systems and access controls to protect your information, but no online service is perfect, so you also need to protect your login and only share event links with intended recipients.

## Where your information is stored and sent

We use service providers that may be located in New Zealand or overseas. This means your personal information may be stored or accessed in countries other than New Zealand.

Where we transfer personal information outside New Zealand, we take reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected by privacy safeguards that are comparable to those in the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020. This may include using contractual protections or choosing providers in countries with similar legal protections.

---

**Put simply**

Your information may be stored overseas, but we require similar privacy protections to those in New Zealand law wherever it goes.

## Your rights and how to exercise them

You have rights under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, including the right to:

- ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you
- ask us to correct any personal information that you believe is wrong or incomplete

If you would like to request a copy of your information, or ask for a correction, please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Statement. We may need to verify your identity before we can respond to your request.

In some cases, we may be unable to provide you with certain information (for example, where doing so would unreasonably affect another person's privacy or would breach our legal obligations). If that happens, we will explain why, to the extent we are reasonably able to do so.

You can also:

- manage some of your information directly through your account settings
- unsubscribe from non-essential emails by using the unsubscribe link in those emails (we will still send you important transactional or service messages when necessary)
- request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us

---

**Put simply**

You can ask to see the information we hold about you, ask us to fix it if it is wrong, manage some settings yourself, and opt out of non-essential emails.

## Age restrictions

With Thanks is intended for use by adults aged 18 and over. If you are under 18, you should not use With Thanks or provide any personal information to us.

Where we become aware that we have collected personal information from a person under 18 without appropriate authority, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that we may have collected personal information about a young person in a way that concerns you, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Privacy Statement.

---

**Put simply**

With Thanks is for adults. If we learn we hold information about minors without proper authority, we will delete it.

## Third-party sites and services

With Thanks may link to or integrate with third-party websites, platforms, or services (for example, a supplier's own website or social media profile).

If you follow a link to any third-party site or service, or choose to share information directly with a third party, their own terms and privacy policies will apply. We are not responsible for how third parties handle your information.

We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any third-party sites or services that you access through With Thanks.

---

**Put simply**

If you click through to supplier websites or social media, their privacy policies apply—not ours.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our Service, our practices, or applicable law.

When we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to let you know (for example, by email or by a notice within the Service) before the updated Privacy Statement takes effect. The updated version will be published in the With Thanks app and/or on our website with an updated "Published" date.

If you continue to use With Thanks after the updated Privacy Statement takes effect, you will be taken to have accepted the updated terms. If you do not agree with the changes, you should stop using the Service and, if you wish, delete your account.

---

**Put simply**

We may update this Privacy Statement as our service or the law changes. We will try to let you know about important updates, and using With Thanks after that means you accept the new version.

## Contact us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, our privacy practices, or how we handle your personal information, or if you wish to make a request or complaint, please contact us at:

We will aim to respond within a reasonable time and in line with our obligations under New Zealand privacy law.
