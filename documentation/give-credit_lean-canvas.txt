1️⃣

**Problem**

- Photographers want to **credit suppliers properly** but:
    - Supplier info is scattered (emails, business cards, memory).
    - Couples are hard to get complete, accurate details from.
- Current process is **manual, slow, and error-prone**.

**Existing Alternatives**

- Manually compile from email threads, business cards, memory, and Instagram.
- Ask couples via messages or questionnaires (often incomplete / inconsistent).
- Copy and paste from previous weddings (leads to errors and missing credits).

4️⃣

**Solution**

- Photographer creates an event and sends a **private link** to the couple.
- **No auth / sign-in required** for the couple to complete it (low barrier).
- Couple fills in supplier details once (names, IG handles, websites, roles).
- Smart supplier search to reduce duplicates.
- Editable over time (before / after wedding).
- Photographer gets a **one-click formatted credit list** copied to clipboard.
- Supplier profiles that can later be claimed.

**Unique Value Prop**

- *One link for couples → clean, reusable supplier credits for photographers.*

**High-Level Concept**

- “Typeform for wedding supplier credits” + “Google Contacts for suppliers” (shared, deduped, reusable).

9️⃣

**Unfair Advantage**

- Built *by* a working photographer, for real workflows.
- Early, structured supplier data (hard to recreate later).
- Network effects as suppliers + photographers repeat.

5️⃣ 

**Channels**

- Photographers’ existing workflows (email, CRM, automations).
- Word of mouth within local wedding industry.

2️⃣

**Customer Segments**

- **Primary**: Wedding photographers (NZ-focused initially).
- **Secondary**: Other wedding suppliers.
- **Data contributors**: Couples.

**Early Adopters**

- Photographers who post supplier credits consistently and care about relationships/referrals.
- Teams already using systems (CRM templates, email automations) and want less manual admin.
- Photographers shooting enough weddings that reusing supplier data saves time.
