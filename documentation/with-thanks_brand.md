# Brand

## Brand Name

**With Thanks**

A community‑building, gratitude‑first brand for attribution done properly. Simple, human, and effortless in how it’s used and how it feels.

## Brand Promise

**Full**:
_Send one link. Get copy‑ready tags — with thanks._

**Tight**:
_One link. Copy‑ready tags, with thanks._

## Core Positioning

With Thanks makes it effortless to show up well for the people around you.

It removes friction from an existing, everyday behaviour: properly tagging and taging everyone involved.

This is not SaaS in the traditional sense. It’s a small, thoughtful tool for supporting community through everyday acts of gratitude.

## Primary Audience

**Photographers who already tag suppliers — and want to do it properly, without extra admin.**

They:

- already intend to tag suppliers
- want tags to be accurate, consistent, and respectful
- don’t want another system to manage or maintain
- care about relationships, reputation, and doing right by people

With Thanks doesn’t preach ethics or try to change behaviour. It supports an existing intent by making the process easier and more reliable.

## Mental Model

Weddings are inherently collaborative, and tagging everyone who contributed is simply part of how the work is shared.

With Thanks fits naturally into that moment. It helps ensure tag is given carefully and consistently, in a way that feels effortless rather than rushed or forgotten.

## Product Truths (Non‑Negotiables)

- Couples contribute once
- Photographers receive copy‑ready outputs
- Suppliers are tagged accurately
- The system improves over time as more people contribute

A shared database of supplier information sits underneath the product, but it never needs to be the focus. The experience always leads with gratitude and recognition for people, and the system simply supports that.

## Tone & Voice

With Thanks sounds human, grounded, and quietly caring.

It reflects everyday decency — being a good collaborator, a good citizen, and someone who looks after the people around them — without ever needing to say that explicitly.

- Human, warm, and down‑to‑earth
- Relationship‑first, not system‑first
- Clear and plainspoken
- Assumes good intent
- Calm, never urgent
- Confident without ego

Gratitude shows up through care, follow‑through, and accuracy rather than emotional language.

Nothing is over‑explained, and nothing is dressed up to feel more important than it is. Doing things properly should feel natural, not like a performance.

## What With Thanks Is Not

- Not a productivity dashboard
- Not a community platform
- Not a lesson in why tags matter
- Not performative, gamified, or self‑congratulatory gratitude

## Internal North Star

**With Thanks helps creative industries look after the people involved — properly, collectively, and without friction.**
