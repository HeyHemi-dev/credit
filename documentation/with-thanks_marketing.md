# Homepage Structure:

1. Clear one-line explanation (hero)
   Not a value prop stack. Just: what this is + who it’s for.
   You already have this — keep it plain.

2. Simple “how it works”
   3 steps max. Visual > text.
   This reduces risk for couples who land here.

3. Social proof (lightweight)
   Not logos or testimonials yet. Instead: signals like “Built by a working photographer”

4. Trust + safety cues
   Especially important here:
   - No login for couples
   - Private links
   - Nothing posted without the photographer

# Brand Positioning

## Truth / anchor

Weddings are a collaboration of many small businesses, all contributing their work to one day.

When photos are shared, tagging and thanking the people involved is simply the right thing to do. It helps suppliers be found, supports small businesses, and strengthens the sense of community the wedding industry is built on.

Most suppliers already try to do this properly. The intent is there.
What’s hard is gathering accurate details — especially when couples are asked to fill out multiple forms, track down handles, and repeat the same work. It’s extra effort for them, so it often doesn’t get done well, or at all.

With Thanks exists to make this easy for everyone.
Suppliers send one simple link and get tags back in the format they need.
Couples only have to do this once, without unnecessary effort or research.

That’s the whole point.

## Affirmation

If you’re already trying to do the right thing — tagging and thanking the suppliers who contributed — this is for you.

With Thanks fits into the way you already work.
Instead of chasing details or sending yet another form, you send one simple link.

The difference is that it’s easier for couples to complete, so the information actually comes back accurate and usable — without extra follow-ups.

## How it works

- You send one private link to the couple
- They search for and add the suppliers involved — most details are already there
- You get copy-ready tags, ready to paste straight into Instagram or wherever you share

## Social proof

With Thanks is built by a working photographer, shaped around real wedding workflows.

It fits quietly alongside the tools you already use, without asking couples or suppliers to learn something new.

It’s just there to make this one part of the process go more smoothly.

## Trust & safety cues

- Couples don’t need to create an account or sign in
- Links are private and shared only by you
- Nothing is posted or shared automatically
- You stay in control of when and how credits are used

This exists to support your work — not get in the way of it.

## Closing invitation

**Try it on your next wedding.**
