## Hero

**Tag everyone — with thanks.**

Send one link. Get copy‑ready tags back.

## How it works

- Send one private link to the couple
- They search for and add the suppliers involved
- You get copy‑ready tags, ready to paste into Instagram

## Why this exists

Weddings are collaborative.

When photos are shared, tagging and thanking the people involved strengthens our community.

The intent is there. The process breaks down — chasing details, incomplete forms, and extra work for couples.

Often, details aren’t filled out well — or at all.

With Thanks makes it easy to follow through.

## Built for real workflows

With Thanks is built by a working photographer, shaped around how weddings actually run.

It fits quietly alongside the tools you already use, and focuses on making this one part of the process easier.

## Trust & control

- No accounts or sign‑in for couples
- Private links, shared only by you
- Nothing is posted automatically
- You decide when and how tags are used

This exists to support your work — not get in the way of it.

**Try it on your next wedding.**
