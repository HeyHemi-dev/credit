# UI Copy Rules.

To be read in conjunction with the brand document.

## Match the weight of the language to the action

**Rule:** Lighter language for quick actions, heavier only when creating shared data.

**Examples:**

- **Crediting flow:**
  - Button: **Save**
  - Labels: “Who it was”, “What they did”

- **Create supplier flow:**
  - Button: **Create**
  - Subline: _This creates a shared supplier others can use._
  - Footer: _Please double-check spelling — this is shared with others._

## Phrase checks and safeguards as help, not correction

**Rule:** Validation and dedupe should feel assistive.

**Examples:**

"We found some similar suppliers. Did you mean one of these?"

Instead of:

- “Possible duplicate”
- “This already exists”
- “Are you sure?”

## Prefer everyday phrasing over formal labels

**Rule:** Use how people speak, not system terms.

**Examples:**

- “Service” → **What they did**
- “Supplier” → **Who it was**
- “Region” → **Based in**
- “Optional” → **If you know it**

These weren’t stylistic — they removed hesitation.
